## About
An unfinished project, where the user would authenticate themselves via Discord and then be redirected to the donation page.
Once connected to the donation page through Phantom (Solana) or MetaMask (Ethereum), the user's NFTs would be retrieved and displayed in a list.
The user can then click on any NFT to donate it to the platform's donation fund.
Project is left unfinished, however the donation page works for Ethereum.
